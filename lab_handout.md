## Lab 0: Project Creation from Scratch

**Duration**: 20 minutes  
**Goal**: Create a lyrics display application from scratch (this is how the `lyrics-trainer` project began, which we'll look at later)

### Setup

1. Create a new empty directory: `mkdir lyrics-display && cd lyrics-display`
2. Initialize git: `git init`
3. Start Claude Code: `claude`
4. Create your first branch: `git checkout -b basic-lyrics-app`
5. Find song lyrics: Google any song title + "lyrics" and copy the lyrics to a text file called `lyrics.txt`

### Exercises

1. **Project foundation**:
   ```
   "I have song lyrics saved in lyrics.txt. Create a web application that displays these lyrics one line at a time with three buttons: Next, Previous, and Play. The Play button should automatically advance through lines with a 2-second delay."
   ```

2. **Enhanced functionality**:
   ```
   "Add line numbering, show progress (e.g., 'Line 5 of 32'), and make the Play button toggle to Pause when active. Style it to look modern and clean."
   ```

3. **Visual improvements**:
   ```
   "Add smooth transitions between lines, better typography, and responsive design. Make it visually appealing with a music-themed color scheme."
   ```

4. **Advanced features**:
   ```
   "Add keyboard shortcuts: spacebar for play/pause, arrow keys for next/previous. Also add a progress bar showing position in the song."
   ```

5. **Documentation and structure**:
   ```
   "Create a README.md explaining the project, and organize the code into separate CSS and JavaScript files for better maintainability."
   ```

6. **Version control and experimentation**:
   ```
   "Help me commit this work, then create a new branch called 'speed-control' and add a slider to control the playback speed."
   ```

### Expected Outcomes

- Build a real, useful application from nothing
- See how Claude Code handles file interactions and user interface logic
- Experience the full development cycle: concept → working app → enhancements
- Understand that this is exactly how the `lyrics-trainer` project started
- Practice iterative development with AI assistance

**Note**: This exercise recreates the origin story of the `lyrics-trainer` project in the exercises folder - you're experiencing the same process that created one of our example applications!

16. **CLAUDE.md creation**:
   ```
   "Create a CLAUDE.md file for this weather app with Python coding standards, dependencies, and project context"
   ```

   Note that the built-in slash command `/init` creates the `CLAUDE.md` file, but you can simply ask Claude to create it.

17. **Custom slash command**:
   ```
   "Help me create a custom slash command called 'update-deps' for updating Python dependencies safely with backup and testing"
   ```

#### Part G: Feature Enhancement with All Tools (5 minutes)

18. **Comprehensive Enhancement**:

   Now use Plan Mode with all your new tools:
   ```
   "Using Plan Mode, add comprehensive error handling and structured logging to this application. The security hook should verify no secrets are added, and generate API documentation using the skill when done."

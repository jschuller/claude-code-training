## Updated Course Description

**Title:** Agentic Coding with Claude Code

**Duration:** 5 hours

**Level:** Intermediate

**Description:**

Master AI-assisted software development with Claude Code, Anthropic's powerful command-line tool that transforms how professional developers write, test, and maintain code. This comprehensive 5-hour course teaches you to harness natural language commands for complete development workflows—from project creation to production deployment.

Learn to extend Claude Code with Skills for persistent domain expertise, automate workflows with Hooks, customize output styles for different contexts, and leverage specialized Subagents for complex tasks. Discover how enterprise teams use Plugins to standardize development practices across organizations.

Through hands-on exercises with real codebases spanning Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Java, you'll explore legacy code modernization, comprehensive test generation, and professional documentation creation. Master the "branch-first" workflow for safe experimentation and learn to integrate Claude Code with your existing development tools including VS Code and git.

By the end of this course, you'll be equipped to integrate Claude Code into your daily workflow, create custom skills and commands for your team, and leverage AI to accelerate development while maintaining code quality and security.
